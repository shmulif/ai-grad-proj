# Grad Project - Supervised Learning  
### Sam Feld, Jay Salgado, Aban Khan, Matt Glennon

This project explores three supervised learning algorithms: **Neural Network**, **Decision Tree**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. Each algorithm is implemented in its own module under the `code/` directory.

## Project Structure

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Neural Network
To run the neural network model:

```bash
python code/neural_network/neural_network.py
```

### 2. Decision Tree
To run the decision tree model:

```bash
python code/decision_tree/decision_tree.py
```

### 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
To run the KNN algorithm:

```bash
python code/knn/train_and_test.py
```

This will automatically load the dataset and use the implementation found in `knn.py`.
